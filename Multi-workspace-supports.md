This server have been supported multi-workspace by server side since 2.5.7(or 2.6.0).
the client just need to startup one server, then send all lua files to this server(even if they are not included in current workspaces).

Note: the server dose not support dynamically add or remove workspaces, if workspaces changed, client should restart server.
