## How to configure
supports project configuration through the `.editorconfig` file. The `.editorconfig` file must be in the project root directory.
If you want different directories under the same project to use different configurations, you can add `.editorconfig` files to different directories.
Or if you want different files in the current directory to use different configurations, you can configure different files according to the way supported by `.editorconfig`.
