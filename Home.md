# Welcome

***Lua development just got a whole lot better*** üß†

Welcome to [Sumneko's](https://github.com/sumneko) Lua language server wiki!

This repository is home to the Lua language server used by [`sumneko/vscode-lua`](https://github.com/sumneko/vscode-lua) which is a Visual Studio Code extension that operates as the client for this language server using the LSP protocol.

Don't use Visual Studio Code? The server can also be used from the command line so you can use it with other editors that support language servers.

## Features
The language server has plenty of features to explore, here is a list of some of them:
- Over 20 supported [annotations](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Annotations) for documenting your code
- Go to definition
- Dynamic [type checking](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Type-Checking)
- Find references
- [Diagnostics/Warnings](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Diagnostics)
- [Syntax checking](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Syntax-Errors)
- Element renaming
- Hover to view details on variables, functions, and more
- Autocompletion
- Quick fixes (Code Actions)
- Multi-workspace support
- Support for [libraries](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Libraries)
- [Code formatting](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Formatter)
- [Spell checking](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Formatter)
- Custom [plugins](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Plugins)

## Get Started
Check out [Getting Started](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Getting-Started) to start using the Lua language server and start developing better.

## Learn
Below are some resources to learn more about the language server and some of its more advanced features.
### Configuration
To configure the language server just the way you want it, view the [configuration file page](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File) and [settings page](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings).

### Libraries
[Libraries](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Libraries) are supported in a number of ways. There are some super powerful library features that allow you to define your libraries elsewhere and link them to your current workspace with your source code.

### Plugins
If you are looking to extend or modify the Lua syntax but still want to use the language server, [plugins](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Plugins) can allow you to do just that.

### Code Formatter
Making your code look pretty can be a time-sink that can be hard to justify spending time on. Luckily, the language server also comes with a [code formatter](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Code-Formatter) to help you write your prettiest code.
